# RedM resources

> We are not affiliated with Cfx.re, RedM, nor FiveM teams. We just aim to provide a few basic resources for running RedM.

## RedM – Red Dead Redemption 2

1. If you are looking to ‘play the game’, see: [redm-rdr2-client/README.md](redm-rdr2-client/README.md)
2. If you are looking to ‘host a server’, see: [redm-rdr2-server/README.md](redm-rdr2-server/README.md).

## Names, terminology, and other stuff

Names and terminology gets confusing because there are so many small projects working on the greater ecosystem. Below if our personal understanding of the parts and things involved.

* [Cfx.re](https://cfx.re) - team that wrote the Citizen framework, the basis for FiveM and RedM. The also research and maintain documentation of game internals.
* [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) – FiveM is a modification for Grand Theft Auto V enabling you to play multiplayer on customized dedicated servers.
* [RedM](https://redm.net) – RedM is basically the Red Dead Redemption variant of FiveM.
* [VORPCORE](https://github.com/VORPCORE) – Set of additional resources for RedM to allow roleplaying.
* [RedEM-RP](https://github.com/RedEM-RP/redem_roleplay) - Set of additional resources for RedM to allow roleplaying.
* [FXServer](https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem) – the server component for multiplayer services on the Cfx.re projects.
* Citizen is the modding framework, you will only see it when you dig into code.
* [The PRC](https://www.theprc.com) – The People's Role Play Community: a community that hosts and plays on RedM servers with additions to allow roleplay.
* NoPixel: Roleplay community known for GTA 5 roleplay servers. They are working on servers at time of writing (summer 2021), but nothing is running yet.

If you're looking to run your own roleplay server and you don't have a lot of development experience, it's probably best to start with VORP.
